 a language paper. In BCA Course, equal emphasis is given to both theory and practical papers. Practical work in 
 laboratory forms an integral part of BCA curriculum.The course delivery methods include classroom discussion, 
 lectures, seminars, group and individual projects, practical in laboratory. As part of the course requirement, 
 students also have to submit a project report in the final year of BCA.<br>

        However,
 this might differ from university to university. For instance, at Christ University, Bangalore, e-commerce is one
 of the topics a BCA student studies in the fifth semester. While, on the other hand, BCA students at IMS Noida 
  have
 to study – Principle of Management, as a topic in their first semester. Contrary to these, other top BCA colleges
